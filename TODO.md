# Patient Form Improvements TODO

## Tasks
- [x] Update Calendar component to restrict to past dates (up to today), add year/month dropdowns for easier selection, and ensure popover positioning doesn't overflow above/below the field
- [x] Change yearLevel input to select dropdown with options 1-4
- [x] Change block input to select dropdown with options 1-5 (made optional)
- [x] Add placeholders to all form fields (inputs, textareas, selects)
- [x] Fix course options to populate correctly when program is selected (initially empty, populate after selection)

## Followup Steps
